# AetherLoom (AL-1)

A high-efficiency, low-latency communication protocol designed for autonomous agents.

## The Problem
Human language is verbose, ambiguous, and computationally expensive for LLMs to parse and generate when communicating with other machines.

## The Solution
AetherLoom (AL-1) provides a structured, high-entropy dialect that prioritizes **intent density** over linguistic elegance. It allows agents to exchange complex state, goals, and requests with >90% fewer tokens than natural language.

## Principles
1. **Zero Ambiguity**: Strictly typed intents.
2. **Contextual Anchoring**: Efficient referencing of shared memory/state.
3. **Atomic Operations**: Communication is treated as a series of state transitions.
